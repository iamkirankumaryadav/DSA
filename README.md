# Data Structure and Algorithms

- Data structure is a fundamental concept around which we build our programs.
- Data structure provides a particular way of organizing data so it can be accessed efficiently, based on use case.
- If data is well organized it helps in fast lookup.

### Why `DSA` is important?

Python Data Structure

> Builtin Data Structures

1. **List** (Ordered Collection | Mutable | Heterogeneous Data Type | Dynamic Array) 
2. **Tuple** (Ordered Collection | Immutable | Heterogeneous Data Type)
3. **Set** (Unordered Collection | Mutable | Heterogeneous Data Type)
4. **Dictionary** (Ordered Collection | Mutable | Heterogeneous Data Type)

## Big O Notation

Measure How Running Time or Space Reguirements for Program Grows as Input Size Grows.

time = a * n + b  (a and b are Constants | n is Iteration)

Rules :
- Keep Fastest Growing Terms
- Drop Constants

Constant : O(1) | Constant Time Operation

Search By Index | Lookup : O(1)

Loops | Iterations : O(n) (Search an Element in a Sorted Array | Array Traversal)

Insert | Delete (Beginning) : O(1) (Add New Element and Shift other Elements to New Memory Address)

Insert | Delete (Ending) : O(n) (Add New Element and Shift other Elements to New Memory Address)

Insert | Delete (Middle) : O(n) (Add New Element and Shift other Elements to New Memory Address)

Linked List Traversal = O(n)

Accessing Element By Value = O(n)

<h5>2 Iterations : O(n<sup>2</sup>)</h5>

Big Iteration : O(log n) (Binary Search | Unordered Array)

Splitting | Dividing | Merge : O(n log n) (Here n is for Merge)
